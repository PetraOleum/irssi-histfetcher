This is a fairly simple script for irssi. Opening a new query window will
execute a script on the bouncer server via ssh, which will tail the latest log
file of the queried person.

The script is assuming a passwordless access (like, via pubkey from an agent)
to the server, where the histfetcher zsh script is in the home and +x, and it
can read the log_${servertag}/${username}_YYYYMMDD.log
Any of that a problem, rewrite the scripts :)
